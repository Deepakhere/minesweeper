# Minesweeper

A classic puzzle game where players must clear a minefield using logic and careful deduction.

## Game Overview

Minesweeper challenges players to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The game combines strategy, logic, and sometimes a bit of luck.

## Game Rules

### Objective
- Clear the entire board without triggering any mines
- Reveal all safe squares while correctly identifying mine locations

### Gameplay Mechanics

#### Basic Controls
- **Left Click**: Reveal a square
- **Right Click**: Place (or remove) a flag on a suspected mine location
- **Double Click**: (In some versions) Reveal all adjacent squares when the correct number of flags are placed

#### Square Types
- **Numbers (1-8)**: Indicate how many mines are in the adjacent squares
- **Empty Squares**: Reveal automatically when clicked, showing all adjacent safe squares
- **Mines**: Game ends if clicked
- **Flags**: Player-placed markers for suspected mine locations

### How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**
   - First click is always safe
   - The game begins when you reveal your first square

2. **Reading the Numbers**
   - Each number shows the count of mines in the surrounding eight squares
   - Use these numbers to deduce mine locations

3. **Strategic Tips**
   - Start with corners and edges where there are fewer adjacent squares
   - Use flags to mark confirmed mine locations
   - Look for patterns and common configurations

### Winning and Losing

#### Victory Conditions
- All safe squares are revealed
- All mines are correctly flagged (optional)

#### Game Over
- Occurs when clicking on a mine
- Board reveals all mine locations

## Common Strategies

### Basic Techniques
1. When a number touches exactly as many unopened squares as its value, all those squares must be mines
2. When a number has all its mines flagged, all other touching squares must be safe

### Advanced Techniques
- Pattern recognition for common configurations
- Using information from multiple numbers to make deductions
- Process of elimination with neighboring squares

## Difficulty Levels

Most versions offer multiple difficulty settings:

- **Beginner**
  - 8x9 board
  - 10 mines
  - Best for learning the game

- **Intermediate**
  - 15x15 board
  - 40 mines
  - Balanced challenge

- **Expert**
  - 30x16 board
  - 99 mines
  - Maximum difficulty

## Tips for Success

1. Don't guess unless absolutely necessary
2. Use flags strategically to track confirmed mine locations
3. Take your time - there's usually no time pressure
4. Learn common patterns to speed up your gameplay
5. Start with easier difficulty levels to build confidence

## Common Terminology

- **Opening**: The first click and resulting clear area
- **Pattern**: Common configuration of numbers and mines
- **Chording**: Using double-click to reveal multiple squares
- **50/50**: Situation where guessing is unavoidable
- **Safe Square**: Square confirmed to not contain a mine
